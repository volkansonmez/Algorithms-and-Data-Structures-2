    "Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms will be analyzed in this notebook to find MST. These algorithms work only for undirected graphs. Prim's algorithm requires a source vertex to be defined. However, Kruskal's does not require any source vertex to be defined. Prim's algorithm finds the minimal weight spanning tree starting from a given node while continuing to visit each node. Kruskal's algorithm finds minimal weight spanning tree starting from the shortest edges of the nodes that has not been visited while continuing to visit each node\n",
