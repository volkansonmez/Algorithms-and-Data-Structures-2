This is a repository of teaching materials, code, and data for my data analysis and machine learning projects.

Each repository will (usually) correspond to one of the posts on my [website](http://www.pythonicfool.com/).

You are free to:

* **Share**—copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
* **Adapt**—remix, transform, and build upon the material

Under the following terms:

* **Attribution**—You must give appropriate credit (mentioning that your work is derived from work that is © Volkan Sonmez and, where practical, linking to http://www.pythonicfool.com/), and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-2
Algorithms and Data Structures for Data Science and Machine Learning 
(Algorithms and Data Structures Simplified) 


* ### MST Algorithms:
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are analyzed in this notebook to find MST. 

* ### Sorting Algorithms:
Merge Sort- n*logn, Quick Sort- n *logn, Bubble Sort- npow(2)

* ### Basics for Convolution & Intro to Digital Signal Processing:
Basics of Convolution Notebook (array and matrix convolutions and FFT)

* ### DFT, FFT, and Convolution of Signals:
Polynomial Multiplication with DFT, FFT from scratch, and Convolution of Signals 

* ### Network Flow Problems, Bipartite Matching:
Maximizing the network flow, bipartiteness testing, bipartite matching, and visualization of graphs with matplotlib.
