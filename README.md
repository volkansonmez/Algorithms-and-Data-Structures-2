Algorithms and Data Structures for Data Science and Machine Learning 
(Algorithms and Data Structures Simplified) 


### MST Algorithms:
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are analyzed in this notebook to find MST. 

### Sorting Algorithms:
Merge Sort- n*logn, Quick Sort- n *logn, Bubble Sort- npow(2)

### 1- Basics for Convolution & Intro to Digital Signal Processing:
Basics of Convolution Notebook (array and matrix convolutions and FFT)

### 2- Basics for DFT & FFT & Convolution of Signals:
Polynomial Multiplication with DFT, FFT from scratch, and Convolution of Signals 

### Network Flow Problems, Bipartite Matching:
Maximizing the network flow, bipartiteness testing, bipartite matching, and visualization of graphs with matplotlib.
