Algorithms and Data Structures for Data Science and Machine Learning 
(Algorithms and Data Structures Simplified) 


### MST Algorithms:
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are analyzed in this notebook to find MST. 





The future deposits for this repository will be: 
Sorting algorithms, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Network Flow, Bipartite matching, DFT, FFT, Trie Structure.
