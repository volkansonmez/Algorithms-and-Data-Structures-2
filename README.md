Algorithms and Data Structures for Data Science and Machine Learning 
(Algorithms and Data Structures Simplified) 


### MST Algorithms:
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are analyzed in this notebook to find MST. 

### Sorting Algorithms:
Merge Sort- n*logn, Quick Sort- n *logn, Bubble Sort- npow(2)

### Basics for Digital Signal Processing:
Taking DFT, FFT, IFFT, and Convolution of Signals




The future deposits for this repository will be: 
Network Flow, Bipartite matching, Trie Structure.
